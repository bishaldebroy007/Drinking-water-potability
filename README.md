# Drinking-water-potability
Datasets: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability

This project aims to predict the potability of water based on various physicochemical features, 
such as pH, hardness, solids, and more. The project uses three machine learning models: Logistic Regression, 
Random Forest, and XGBoost, to classify water samples as potable or non-potable. 
The project also compares the performance of the models and evaluates their accuracy, precision, and recall.

The project uses Python as the programming language and various libraries, such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, 
seaborn, sci-kit-learn, and lime. The project is presented in a Jupyter notebook that contains detailed 
explanations and comments for each step. 
The project is intended for anyone interested in water quality analysis and machine learning applications.
